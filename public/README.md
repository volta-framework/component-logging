# Public: Examples

In this public directory there is one script called `index.php`. The script can be run on the command line or in the browser served through the PHP build in web-server. The latter can be started with the following command executed in the terminal in this folder. In this case the result of the log can be watched in the browser __and__ on the command line!

```shell
php -S localhost:8080 index.php
```

Or called directly on the command line:
```shell
php index.php
```
